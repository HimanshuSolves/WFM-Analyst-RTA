# WFM Excel Tools

This repository contains two macro-enabled Excel tools designed for Workforce Management (WFM) teams:

- `WFM - REAL TIME ANALYST.xlsm`: Tools and macros tailored for real-time monitoring and adherence.
- `WFM - ANALYST FUNCTIONS.xlsm`: Tools intended for workforce analysts for reporting and forecasting.

```

## 🛠 VBA Macro Access

The macro from `WFM - REAL TIME ANALYST.xlsm` has been extracted as a `.bin` file (`vbaProject.bin`). You can import or review it using tools like [Office VBA editor](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office/vba/library-reference/concepts/getting-started-with-vba-in-office).

## 📄 Documentation

See [`docs/workbook_structure.md`](docs/workbook_structure.md) for a breakdown of sheets, formulas, and macro functions.

## 💾 How to Use
